# Obsidian Vault prompt and output saving utility

## Purpose Statement

This program is a simple GUI for saving prompts and outputs into an Obsidian vault that is structured for saving LLM "things".

My Obsidian Vault has a structure that includes folders for:

```
/agents
/prompts
/outputs
```

... and is detailed in other repositories. 

## Requirements

You'll need an OpenAI API key to use this GUI.
